# Release Planning

A Release Planning is a tactical document designed to capture and track the features planned for an upcoming release.

> There are two possible options to display this table inside the __README.md__ file or on its own __Release_Planning.md__ document. Each Working Group repository where the Group is developing technical content should have its Release_Planning table.

## Release Planning Table

Each Working Group should create and maintain its own set of Release Planning Documents. In its simplest form, this document is a table (a Release Roadmap), which reflects the expectations about which features will be implemented and by when.
