# Setting up Community Specification for a GitHub Organization

## Overview and Scope

This guide describes the steps to take within GitHub to implement the [Community Specification 1.1](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/tree/V1.1) license and governance process for a new project, where multiple specification documents can each be developed in their own repositories.

This guide assumes the following:

* You are creating a new specification, without pre-existing public content
* Your project has set up a GitHub organization account
* Your project might develop multiple specification documents in multiple repositories
* You have minimal experience with Git and GitHub
* You'll use the GitHub web interface to edit files for this initial setup process

Some modifications to the steps below might be needed if the assumptions above don't apply to you and your project.

This guide does _not_ address the following:

* reasons why a project might (or might not) decide to implement the Community Specification process
* legal interpretations of the Community Specification license or other aspects of its governance
* modifications that might be desirable when implementing Community Specification for a project with a pre-existing specification or community

## Setup Procedure

In the steps below, the following placeholders are used. Be sure to replace these with the applicable values for your project:

* **`MYORG`** -- your GitHub organization's account name
* **`MYSPEC`** -- your specification's repository name

### Objective

// After completing the following steps, your project's GitHub organization will have the following repositories:

* `governance`: contains the Community Specification 1.0 license text and other documents
* `MYSPEC`: contains the substance of the first specification that you're developing
* You could create additional specification repositories with other names using the same process as for MYSPEC.

### Step 1.

Create a new repository in `MYORG` and copy the following files from the Community Specification 1.1 repository [https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/tree/V1.1](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/tree/V1.1):

- **Community Specification Contributor License Agreement.**  
The [.0_CS_Contributor_License_Agreement.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/.0_CS_Contributor_License_Agreement.md) is the agreement that binds participants to the legal and governance terms established for the Working Group, and it binds participants to those terms, governance, and agreements in the official Community Specification repository. This ensures consistency for all projects using these agreements and avoids the risk that the terms have been modified. 

- **Scope.md.**  
The [2._Scope.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/2._Scope.md) file determines the scope of your Working Group. Items beyond that scope are not subject to licensing obligations established by the Community Specification License.    

- **Notices.md.**  
The [3._Notices.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/3._Notices.md) file includes information and notices about the Working Group, including contacts for code of conduct issues, patent exclusions, parties that have specifically notified the community that they are implementing the specification, and parties that have withdrawn from the Working Group.

- **License.md.**  
The [4._License.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/4._License.md) file includes a statement notifying people that the project is under the Community Specification License, and the license for any source code included with the specification.

- **Contributing.md.**
The [6._Contributing.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/6._Contributing.md) file describes a generic contribution guidelines that it may be updated based on the Group needs.

- **CS_Template**
The [7._CS_Template.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/7._CS_Template.md) file is a Technical Specification template to build a technical document. In a repository it can be one or multiple of this template. Each technical document file should have an unique filename.

- **Release Planning.md**
The [9._Release_Planning.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/9._Release_Planning.md) file contains a single table that indicates what features will be released and when.

- **ORG_Process**
The [10._ORG_Process.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/10._ORG_Process.md)

### Step 2.

Fill in the required information.

- **Scope.md.**  Complete the Scope.md file, which determines the scope of your Working Group and its patent coverage.

- **Notices.md.** Add the contact(s) for code of conduct issues.

- **License.md.** If any source or sample code will be included in the specification, designate a source code license in the License.md file. The default license is MIT, and you may change that to an open source license of your choosing.

### Step 3.

Develop your specification in that repository. 


# Best Practices.

1. **CLA bot.** Enable a CLA bot, such as EasyCLA or cla-bot, to require a **Community Specification Contributor License Agreement** be signed (either by an individual contributor or by a contributor's employer, which CLA covers the employed contributor) and in place prior to making any contribution.

1. **Use for specifications, not code.**  Use the Community Specification License for specification development, not code.

1. **Scope.** Draft the scope with care since it sets the outer bounds of the patent commitments participants make to the specification.  If you draft it too narrowly, you may limit the functionality of the specification, especially as the project progresses.  Draft it too broadly and it may provide a barrier to participation since participants may be unwilling to agree to potentially broad patent commitments.  For guidance on drafting an appropriate Scope, you may find [ISO's guidance (see page 5)](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/how-to-write-standards.pdf "ISO How To Write Standards Guide") helpful.

1.  **Specification format.**  Use the Community Specification Template to draft your specification.

1. **Develop specifications and code in separate repositories.**  Where possible, separate specifications and source code into different repositories, with the specifications under the Community Specification License and the source code under an OSI-approved open source license.  

1. **Develop multiple specifications in separate repositories.** When developing multiple specifications, each individual specification should be in its own repository.
