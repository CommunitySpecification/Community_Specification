# Setting up Community Specification for a GitHub Organization

## Overview and Scope

This guide describes the steps within GitHub to implement the <a href="https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/CS_Reference/tree/v1.0" target="_blank">Community Specification v1.0</a>license, and governance process for a new project, where multiple specification documents can each be developed in their repositories.

This guide assumes the following:

* You are creating a new specification without pre-existing public content
* Your project has set up a GitHub organization account
* Your project might develop multiple specification documents in multiple repositories
* You have minimal experience with Git and GitHub
* You'll use the GitHub web interface to edit files for this initial setup process

> If the assumptions above don't apply to you and your project, you might modify some steps. 

This guide does _not_ address the following:

* reasons why a project might (or might not) decide to implement the Community Specification process
* legal interpretations of the Community Specification license or other aspects of its governance
* modifications that might be desirable when implementing Community Specification for a project with a pre-existing specification or community

## Setup Procedure

In the steps below, the following placeholders are used. 

* **`MYORG`** -- your GitHub organization's account name
* **`MYSPEC`** -- your specification's repository name
* **`governance`** -- new repository, recommended if you are planning to have two or more repositories for developing Technical Specifications

> Be sure to replace these names with the applicable values for your project.

### Objective

After completing the following steps, your project's GitHub organization will have the following repositories:

* **`governance`**: contains governance documents such as:
  * *Community_Specification_License*,
  * *Governance*,
  * *Code of Conduct*, and
  * *Organization_Process*

> We assume that the Organization is developing technical documents in more than one repository.
> The `governance` repository is unnecessary if the Organization has a single repository. In this case, *process* and *technical* documents are developed in **`MYSPEC`** repository. 

* **`MYSPEC`**: Each repository contains the substance of the *Specification* that you're developing.
  * If you create additional *Specification* repositories, remember to assign a different name to each **`MYSPEC`** repository.

## Implemenation Steps

* **Step 1** - copy Community Specification templates
* **Step 2** - paste & delete documents as necessary
* **Step 3** - customize the documents 

For further details about how to implement these three steps, we have built step-by-step guidelines available [here]()

# Best Practices.

1. **CLA bot.** Enable a CLA bot, such as EasyCLA or cla-bot, to require a **Community Specification Contributor License Agreement** be signed (either by an individual contributor or by a contributor's employer, which CLA covers the employed contributor) and in place prior to making any contribution.

1. **Use for specifications, not code.**  Use the Community Specification License for specification development, not code.

1. **Scope.** Draft the scope with care since it sets the outer bounds of the patent commitments participants make to the specification.  If you draft it too narrowly, you may limit the functionality of the specification, especially as the project progresses.  Draft it too broadly and it may provide a barrier to participation since participants may be unwilling to agree to potentially broad patent commitments.  For guidance on drafting an appropriate Scope, you may find [ISO's guidance (see page 5)](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/archive/pdf/en/how-to-write-standards.pdf "ISO How To Write Standards Guide") helpful.

1.  **Specification format.**  Use the Community Specification Template to draft your specification.

1. **Develop specifications and code in separate repositories.**  Where possible, separate specifications and source code into different repositories, with the specifications under the Community Specification License and the source code under an OSI-approved open source license.  

1. **Develop multiple specifications in separate repositories.** When developing multiple specifications, each individual specification should be in its own repository.
