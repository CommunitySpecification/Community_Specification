# Setting up Community Specification for a GitHub Organization

## Overview and Scope

This guide describes the steps to take within GitHub to implement the [Community Specification 1.1](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/tree/V1.1) license and governance process for a new project, where multiple specification documents can each be developed in their own repositories.

This guide assumes the following:

* You are creating a new specification, without pre-existing public content
* Your project has set up a GitHub organization account
* Your project might develop multiple specification documents in multiple repositories
* You have minimal experience with Git and GitHub
* You'll use the GitHub web interface to edit files for this initial setup process

Some modifications to the steps below might be needed if the assumptions above don't apply to you and your project.

This guide does _not_ address the following:

* reasons why a project might (or might not) decide to implement the Community Specification process
* legal interpretations of the Community Specification license or other aspects of its governance
* modifications that might be desirable when implementing Community Specification for a project with a pre-existing specification or community

## Setup Procedure

In the steps below, the following placeholders are used. Be sure to replace these with the applicable values for your project:

* **`MYORG`** -- your GitHub organization's account name
* **`MYSPEC`** -- your specification's repository name

### Objective

// After completing the following steps, your project's GitHub organization will have the following repositories:

* `governance`: contains a practical implementation of `MYORG` Process and other documents that are relevant to `MYORG` as a whole
* `MYSPEC`: contains the substance of the first specification that you're developing
* You could create additional specification repositories with other names using the same process as for MYSPEC.

### Step 1.

Create a new repository `MYSPEC` in the GitHub Organization's account `MYORG`:

> * Click the `+` button on the upper right of the GitHub page, and select `New repository`
> * Make sure that `Owner` is set to `MYORG`, and fill in the `MYSPEC` name for `Repository name`
> * Under `Description`, fill in a short description of the specification in a few words
> * Make sure `Public` is selected
> * Under `Initialize this repository with:`, select `Add a README file` and make sure the other options are left unchecked
> * Click the `Create repository` button

Then, copy the following files from the Community Specification 1.1 repository [https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/tree/V1.1](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/tree/V1.1):

- **Community Specification Contributor License Agreement.**  
The [.0_CS_Contributor_License_Agreement.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/.0_CS_Contributor_License_Agreement.md) is the agreement that binds participants to the legal and governance terms established for the Working Group, and it binds participants to those terms, governance, and agreements in the official Community Specification repository. This ensures consistency for all projects using these agreements and avoids the risk that the terms have been modified. 

- **Scope.md.**  
The [2._Scope.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/2._Scope.md) file determines the scope of your Working Group. Items beyond that scope are not subject to licensing obligations established by the Community Specification License.    

- **Notices.md.**  
The [3._Notices.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/3._Notices.md) file includes information and notices about the Working Group, including contacts for code of conduct issues, patent exclusions, parties that have specifically notified the community that they are implementing the specification, and parties that have withdrawn from the Working Group.

- **License.md.**  
The [4._License.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/4._License.md) file includes a statement notifying people that the project is under the Community Specification License, and the license for any source code included with the specification.

- **Contributing.md.**
The [6._Contributing.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/6._Contributing.md) file describes a generic contribution guidelines that it may be updated based on the Working Group needs.

- **CS_Template**
The [7._CS_Template.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/7._CS_Template.md) file is a Technical Specification template to build a technical document. In a repository it can be one or multiple of this template. Each technical document file should have an unique filename.

- **Release Planning.md**
The [9._Release_Planning.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/9._Release_Planning.md) file contains in its simple format a single table indicating what features will be released and by when.

> Note: If it is expected that `MYORG` will have multiple repositories containing Technical Specifications, then we suggest that the document `10._ORG_Process.md` should be copied to a new repository, e.g., `governance`. This document contains processes that are generic across the Organization.

- **ORG_Process**
The [10._ORG_Process.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/10._ORG_Process.md) file describes procedures and best practice on how to succesfully implement and run a Community Specifications Project. This document may change based on the needs of `MYORG`.
We highly recommend that this file should be copied to a different repository, e.g., `governance` its content provides governance for all the Organization Working Groups.

### Step 2.
After copying the above files to `MYSPEC` and `governance` repositories respectively, you will need to do some changes to them, to fill in some of the template options, as well as to adjust some assumptions that they make.

For each of the following files, you'll take the following steps to make the changes described below:

> * click on the filename in the `MYSPEC` or `governance` repository
> * on the file's page, click the `Edit button` (looks like a pencil on the right side of the screen)
> * edit the file's text contents
> * after editing the text, in the `Commit changes` box at the bottom:
>  * in the first text box, fill in a short description with a few words, such as `Edited Scope document`
>  * in the second text box, where it says "Add an optional extended description...", add a DCO sign-off line with the following, using your name and email address: `Signed-off-by: NAME <EMAIL ADDRESS>`
>  * make sure the "Commit directly to the `main` branch" button is selected
>  * click the `"Commit changes"` button

Using the process above for each one, edit the files as follows:

In `MYSPEC` repository fill in the required information for these files: 

* `.0_CS_Contributor_License_Agreement.md`:
  * In the title of the document (in the first line), change "Community Specification Contributor License Agreement 1.1" to "MYORG Contributor License Agreement 1.1".

* `2._Scope.md`:
Complete the Scope.md file, which determines the scope of your Working Group and its patent coverage by:
  * Replace the first main sentence ("[Include a detailed description...") with a description of the substance of what the specification's scope will include.
  * The link to ISO's guidance (see page 5 of the linked PDF) may be useful in drafting the scope.

  > For an example, see [SPDX's Scope document](https://github.com/spdx/governance/blob/main/2._Scope.md).

* `3._Notices.md`:
  * Under `Code of Conduct` section, fill in the blank with names and email addresses for at least _two different individuals_ from the project who will be designated to receive Code of Conduct inquiries or issues.

> Note that these should be individual persons, and not general mailing list addresses. Ideally select two or more people from different employers / organizations.

  * After filling in the blank, delete the following sentence ("[Ideally list two different individuals...")
  * Do not fill in the blanks for the remainder of the file, unless your organization is designating exclusions from the Community Specification License's patent license grant. If so, consult with your legal counsel about what should be filled in here.

* `4._License.md`:
If any source or sample code will be included in the specification, designate a source code license in the License.md file.
  * Under "Specification License", change "repository" to "GitHub organization".
  * Under "Source Code License", the default license for software source code is **MIT**. If a license other than **MIT** will be used for software source code, then change each instance of `MIT` to the [SPDX License Identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses) for the chosen software license.

* `6._Contributing.md`:
  * Review this policy for the actual process of specification development and contributions, and make any appropriate changes for the way your project community will work.
  * If you revise the contents of the policy, also replace "Community Specification" with `MYORG` in the name of the policy.

In the `governance` repository update the `README.md` file:
* `README.md`
  * Replace the generic `governance` README file with a brief description of the project's governance repo, such as the following:

```
# MYORG Governance
This repo contains documents that describe the governance practices for the MYORG Working Group.
The MYORG Working Group oversees development of the MYORG materials in the [MYORG GitHub org](https://github.com/MYORG). Specifications developed by the MYORG Working Group are developed in their own repositories, and are subject to the licensing and governance policies described in this repo.
The MYORG Governance process is based on the [Community Specification model and license](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/tree/V1.1) from the [Joint Development Foundation](https://www.jointdevelopment.org).
```  

### Step 3: Set up the starting files for the MYSPEC repository



# Best Practices.

1. **CLA bot.** Enable a CLA bot, such as EasyCLA or cla-bot, to require a **Community Specification Contributor License Agreement** be signed (either by an individual contributor or by a contributor's employer, which CLA covers the employed contributor) and in place prior to making any contribution.

1. **Use for specifications, not code.**  Use the Community Specification License for specification development, not code.

1. **Scope.** Draft the scope with care since it sets the outer bounds of the patent commitments participants make to the specification.  If you draft it too narrowly, you may limit the functionality of the specification, especially as the project progresses.  Draft it too broadly and it may provide a barrier to participation since participants may be unwilling to agree to potentially broad patent commitments.  For guidance on drafting an appropriate Scope, you may find [ISO's guidance (see page 5)](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/how-to-write-standards.pdf "ISO How To Write Standards Guide") helpful.

1.  **Specification format.**  Use the Community Specification Template to draft your specification.

1. **Develop specifications and code in separate repositories.**  Where possible, separate specifications and source code into different repositories, with the specifications under the Community Specification License and the source code under an OSI-approved open source license.  

1. **Develop multiple specifications in separate repositories.** When developing multiple specifications, each individual specification should be in its own repository.
