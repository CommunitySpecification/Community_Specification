# Setting up Community Specification for a GitHub Organization

## Overview and Scope

This guide describes the steps to take within GitHub to implement the [Community Specification v1.0](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/CS_Reference/tree/v1.0) license and governance process for a new project, where multiple specification documents can each be developed in their own repositories.

This guide assumes the following:

* You are creating a new specification, without pre-existing public content
* Your project has set up a GitHub organization account
* Your project might develop multiple specification documents in multiple repositories
* You have minimal experience with Git and GitHub
* You'll use the GitHub web interface to edit files for this initial setup process

Some modifications to the steps below might be needed if the assumptions above don't apply to you and your project.

This guide does _not_ address the following:

* reasons why a project might (or might not) decide to implement the Community Specification process
* legal interpretations of the Community Specification license or other aspects of its governance
* modifications that might be desirable when implementing Community Specification for a project with a pre-existing specification or community

## Setup Procedure

In the steps below, the following placeholders are used. 

* **`MYORG`** -- your GitHub organization's account name
* **`MYSPEC`** -- your specification's repository name
* **`governance`** -- new repository, recommended if you are planning to have two or more repositories for developing Technical Specifications

> Be sure to replace these names with the applicable values for your project.

### Objective

After completing the following steps, your project's GitHub organization will have the following repositories:

* **`governance`**: contains governance documents such as:
  * *1._Community_Specification_License*,
  * *5._Governance*,
  * *8._Code of Conduct*, and
  * *10._Organization_Process*

> We are assuming that the Organization is developing technical documents in more than one repository.
>If the Organization has a single repository, then the `governance` repository may not be needed. The documents listed above, and the Technical Specifications are stored and developed in **`MYSPEC`** repository. 

* **`MYSPEC`**: Each repository contains the substance of the Specification that you're developing.
  * If you create additional Specification repositories remember assign a different name to each **`MYSPEC`** repository.

> The diagram below depictures the steps for creating one or multiple Community Specification repositories from the CS Template repository.

The three steps defined on the diagram are described on the below sections.


## Step 1 
### Create a new repository **`MYSPEC`** in **`MYORG`** GitHub Account

**To create repositories using the GitHub web interface.**

> Please use the GitHub web interface for this step, don't use `Fork` or `Clone` operations as this will provide you with a repository template rather than a repository to developing Specifications.

> * Go to [Community Specification](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification) template repository
> * Click `Use this template` green button at the top menu of the GitHub page,
> * Make sure that `Owner` is set to **`MYORG`**, and fill in the **`MYSPEC`** name for `Repository name`.
> * Under `Description`, fill in a short description of the specification in a few words.
> * Make sure `Public` is selected.
> * Untick `Include all branches` (if selected), you don't need them.
> * Click on the `Create repository from template` button.

GitHub creates a repository on your **MYORG** account containing all the Governance and Development files. 

If your plan is to have a single repository to develop Technical Specificiations you can now go to [Step 3](#step-3).

If you want more than one repository to develop Technical Specifications, then please repeat [Step 1](#step-1) for each Technical Specification repository.

When creating multiple **MYSpec** repositories, remember to name one of repository as **Governance**. We will customize this repository in [Step 2](#step-2) & [Step 3](#step-3) with only _governance_ documents.

Once you have created all the repositories _(included the **Governance** repo)_, then go to [Step 2](#step-2)

## Step 2
### Removing Unncessary Documents From Repositories
At the end of this step, you will have a single repository called **Governance**, and one or more **MySpecs** repositories where the group can develop Technical Specifications.

> This step is used if you are having more than one repository to build Technical Specifications. If you Organization contains a single Technical repository, then please to [Step 3](#step-3)

**Governance** repository only contain documents related to the *process*. 
These documents are:
* **Community Specification License**
* **Governance**
* **Code of Conduct**
* **Organization Process**

**MySpecs** repositories only contain documents used to develop Technical Specifications. 
These documents are:
* **Contributor License Agreement**
* **Scope**
* **Notices**
* **License**
* **Contributing**
* **Specifications** (foder), with one of more _Community Specification template_
* **Release Planning**

**Delete unwanted documents in a repository using GitHub web interface**

> * Go to the repository where you want to delete the document
> * Click on the document to delete. _(A new page will open)_.
> * Click on the `delete` icon on the left-hand side of the screen
> * Insert a _Title_ and _Description_ to commit this change
> * Click on `Commit changes` button at the button of the screen

Repeat the above steps to delete any unwanted documents inside of the repositories.

> These steps assume that you are the Editor or Maintaner and have WRITE access to the repository.

Once you have deleted all the unwanted documents, then move to [Step 3](#step-3).

## Step 3
### Customizing Governance and Development documents

In this step, we will customize the documents in the repository(ries).

__To `edit` an existing file, takes these steps:__

> * Click on the filename in the **`MYSPEC`** or **`governance`** repository
> * On the file's page, click the `Edit button` (_looks like a pencil on the right side of the screen_)
> * Edit the file's text contents
> * After editing the text, in the `Commit changes` box at the bottom:
> * In the first text box, fill in a short description with a few words, e.g., `Edited Scope document`
> * In the second text box, where it says `Add an optional extended description...`, add a DCO sign-off line with the following, using your name and email address: `Signed-off-by: NAME <EMAIL ADDRESS>`
> * Make sure the `Commit directly to the correct branch` button is selected
> * Click the `Commit changes` button

As mentioned previously, the Community Specifications contain two different set of documents: 
* _governance_ or _process_, and 
  * If you are planning to develop Technical Specifications in more than one repository, then use **`governance`** repository to store this type of documents
* _development_ or _technical_ documents
  * These documents are developed in one or multiple **`MYSPEC`** repositories

#### Governance** or Process Documents

These are the changes that we need to apply to each document:

* **Community Specification License**
  * This document is a placeholder that contains a reference to the Community Specification License. The link inside of this document points to the [SC_Reference](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/CS_Reference) repository that is maintained by JDF/LF.
  * You should **not** mofidy this document.

* **Governance**
  * As above, this document contains a link to the _Governance.md_ document in the [SC_Reference](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/CS_Reference) repository maintained by the JDF/LF.
  * You should **not** modify this document.

* **Code of Conduct**
  * You should **not** modify this document either. The link inside of this document points to the _Code of Conduct_ document maitained by JDF/LF on the [SC_Reference](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/CS_Reference) repository/

* **Organization Process**
  * The _Organization Process_ document contains procedures and best practices on how to develop Technical Specifications documents.
  * The group should fell free to customize the document with group's own procedures and agreements.
  * A detailed explanation of the process used by Standards Development Organizations can be found on [wiki](). Feel free to incorporate some of the procedures and best practices explain on the wiki.

Assuming that a new repository **`governance`** was created, then update the `README.md`.

* **`README`**
  * Replace the generic **`governance`** README file with a brief description of the project's governance repo, such as the following:

```md
# MYORG Governance

This repo contains documents that describe the governance practices for the **`MYORG`** Working Group.
The **`MYORG`** Working Group oversees development of the **`MYORG`**  materials in the [MYORG GitHub org](https://github.com/MYORG). Specifications developed by the **`MYORG`**  Working Group are developed in their own repositories, and are subject to the licensing and governance policies described in this repo.
The **`MYORG`**  Governance process is based on the [Community Specification model and license](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/tree/V1.1) from the [Joint Development Foundation](https://www.jointdevelopment.org).
```  

#### Development** or **Technical** Documents:

These are the changes that we need to apply to each document:

* **Community Specification Contributor License Agreement.**  
The *CS Contributor License Agreement* is the agreement that binds participants to the legal and governance terms established for the Working Group, and it binds participants to those terms, governance, and agreements in the official Community Specification repository. This ensures consistency for all projects using these agreements and avoids the risk that the terms have been modified. 

  * In the title of the document (in the first line), change __"Community Specification Contributor License Agreement 1.1"__ to __"MYORG Contributor License Agreement 1.1"__.

* **Scope.md.**  
The *Scope* document determines the scope of your Working Group. Items beyond that scope are not subject to licensing obligations established by the Community Specification License.

  * Complete the `Scope.md` file, which determines the scope of your Working Group and its patent coverage by:
  * Replace the first main sentence ("[Include a detailed description...") with a description of the substance of what the specification's scope will include.
  * The link to ISO's guidance (see page 5 of the linked PDF) may be useful in drafting the scope.

> For an example, see [SPDX's Scope document](https://github.com/spdx/governance/blob/main/2._Scope.md).

* **Notices.md.**  
The *Notices* document includes information and notices about the Working Group, including contacts for code of conduct issues, patent exclusions, parties that have specifically notified the community that they are implementing the specification, and parties that have withdrawn from the Working Group.

  * Under `Code of Conduct` section, fill in the blank with names and email addresses for at least _two different individuals_ from the project who will be designated to receive Code of Conduct inquiries or issues.

> Note that these should be individual persons, and not general mailing list addresses. Ideally select two or more people from different employers / organizations.

   * After filling in the blank, delete the following sentence (*[Ideally list two different individuals...*)
   * Do not fill in the blanks for the remainder of the file, unless your organization is designating exclusions from the Community Specification License's patent license grant. If so, consult with your legal counsel about what should be filled in here.

* **License.md.**  
The *License* file includes a statement notifying people that the project is under the Community Specification License, and the license for any source code included with the specification.

  * If any source or sample code will be included in the specification, designate a source code license in the *License* file.
  * Under the __Specification License__ title, change "repository" to "**`MYORG`** GitHub organization".
  * Under __Source Code License__ title, the default license for software source code is **MIT**. If a license other than **MIT** will be used for software source code, then change each instance of **MIT** to the [SPDX License Identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses) for the chosen software license.

* **Contributing.md.**

The *Contributing* file describes a generic contribution guidelines that it may be updated based on the Working Group needs.

  * Review this policy for the actual process of specification development and contributions, and make any appropriate changes for the way your project community will work.
  * If you revise the contents of the policy, also replace __Community Specification__ with **`MYORG`** in the name of the policy.

* **Specifications** folder

Contains one or more Technical documents based on the *CS_Template*. This Technical Specification template contains all the relevant sections used by an *Standards Development Organization* to build its *Technical Specifications*. Inside of this folder, it can be one or multiple Technical Specification document.

* **Release Planning.md**

The *Release_Planning* document contains a table with technical features and release milestones.

* **ORG_Process**

The ORG_Process document describes procedures and best practices on how to implement and run a Community Specification Project successfully. This document may change based on the needs of **`MYORG`**.

* **`README`**
* Edit the `README.md` file to add a brief description of the specification to be developed.
  * You will want to include a reference back to the **`governance`** repo, such as the following (making appropriate substitutions):

```md
# MYSPEC Specification

This repo is used for collaboration and development of the MYSPEC specification.
The MYSPEC Specification is developed pursuant to the [MYORG Governance practices](https://github.com/MYORG/governance) and licensed pursuant to the [Community Specification License](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/CS_Reference/blob/v1.0/Community_Specification_License-v1.md).
Contributions to the MYSPEC Specification are required to be submitted pursuant to the [MYORG Contributor License Agreement](.0_CS_Contributor_License_Agreement).
```


# Best Practices.

1. **CLA bot.** 
Enable a CLA bot, such as EasyCLA or cla-bot, to require a **Community Specification Contributor License Agreement** be signed (either by an individual contributor or by a contributor's employer, which CLA covers the employed contributor) and in place prior to making any contribution.

1. **Use for specifications, not code.**  Use the Community Specification License for specification development, not code.

1. **Scope.** 
Draft the scope with care since it sets the outer bounds of the patent commitments participants make to the specification.  If you draft it too narrowly, you may limit the functionality of the specification, especially as the project progresses.  Draft it too broadly and it may provide a barrier to participation since participants may be unwilling to agree to potentially broad patent commitments.  For guidance on drafting an appropriate Scope, you may find [ISO How To Write Standards Guide](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/how-to-write-standards.pdf) helpful, (see page 5).

1. **Specification format.**  
Use the [Community Specification Template](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/7._CS_Template.md) to draft your specification.

1. **Develop specifications and code in separate repositories.**  
Where possible, separate specifications and source code into different repositories, with the specifications under the Community Specification License and the source code under an OSI-approved open source license.  

1. **Develop multiple specifications in separate repositories.** 
When developing multiple specifications, each individual specification should be in its own repository.
