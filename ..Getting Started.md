# Setting up Community Specification for a GitHub Organization

## Overview and Scope

This guide describes the steps to take within GitHub to implement the [Community Specification v1.0](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/CS_Reference/tree/v1.0) license and governance process for a new project, where multiple specification documents can each be developed in their own repositories.

This guide assumes the following:

* You are creating a new specification, without pre-existing public content
* Your project has set up a GitHub organization account
* Your project might develop multiple specification documents in multiple repositories
* You have minimal experience with Git and GitHub
* You'll use the GitHub web interface to edit files for this initial setup process

Some modifications to the steps below might be needed if the assumptions above don't apply to you and your project.

This guide does _not_ address the following:

* reasons why a project might (or might not) decide to implement the Community Specification process
* legal interpretations of the Community Specification license or other aspects of its governance
* modifications that might be desirable when implementing Community Specification for a project with a pre-existing specification or community

## Setup Procedure

In the steps below, the following placeholders are used. 
> Be sure to replace these with the applicable values for your project:

* **`MYORG`** -- your GitHub organization's account name
* **`MYSPEC`** -- your specification's repository name
* **`governance`** -- recommended if you are planning to have two or more repositories for developing Technical Specifications

### Objective

After completing the following steps, your project's GitHub organization will have the following repositories:

* **`governance`**: contains governance documents such as:
  * *1._Community_Specification_License*,
  * *5._Governance*,
  * *8._Code of Conduct*, and
  * *10._Organization_Process*

> We are assuming that the Organization is developing technical documents in more than one repository.
>If the Organization has a single repository to develop technical documents, then the `governance` repository is  not needed. The techncal documents and the documents listed above will be stored on the same repository, **`MYSPEC`**. 

* **`MYSPEC`**: contains the substance of the first specification that you're developing
* You could create additional specification repositories with other names using the same process as for **`MYSPEC`**.

### Step 1: Create a new repository **`MYSPEC`** in **`MYORG`** GitHub Account

__To create a new repository **`MYSPEC`** in the GitHub Organization's account **`MYORG`**:__

> * Select `Repository` on the top menu of the GitHub page, and click `New repository`
> * Make sure that `Owner` is set to **`MYORG`**, and fill in the **`MYSPEC`** name for `Repository name`
> * Under `Description`, fill in a short description of the specification in a few words
> * Make sure `Public` is selected
> * Under `Initialize this repository with:`, select `Add a README file` and make sure the other options are left unchecked
> * Click the `Create repository` button

__To create a new file in a repository follow these steps:__

>  * Go to **`MYSPEC`** repository, (_this name is a placehoder for your specification repository_)
>  * Click `Add file` => `Create new file`
>  * For the filename, enter `FileName.md` (*as indicated below*)
>  * Copy the contents of the default template as indicated below. _The links provided below point to the raw content of each file to facilicate the copy and paste_.
>  * Paste the content into the new file's text box
> * Provie a `Title` and `Description` and commit the content

__Copy the following files from the [Community Specification 1.1](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/tree/V1.1) repository__: (*the links below point to the raw content of these files*)

- **Community Specification Contributor License Agreement.**  
The [.0_CS_Contributor_License_Agreement.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/.0_CS_Contributor_License_Agreement.md) file is the agreement that binds participants to the legal and governance terms established for the Working Group, and it binds participants to those terms, governance, and agreements in the official Community Specification repository. This ensures consistency for all projects using these agreements and avoids the risk that the terms have been modified. 

- **Scope.md.**  
The [2._Scope.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/2._Scope.md) file determines the scope of your Working Group. Items beyond that scope are not subject to licensing obligations established by the Community Specification License.    

- **Notices.md.**  
The [3._Notices.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/3._Notices.md) file includes information and notices about the Working Group, including contacts for code of conduct issues, patent exclusions, parties that have specifically notified the community that they are implementing the specification, and parties that have withdrawn from the Working Group.

- **License.md.**  
The [4._License.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/4._License.md) file includes a statement notifying people that the project is under the Community Specification License, and the license for any source code included with the specification.

- **Contributing.md.**

The [6._Contributing.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/6._Contributing.md) file describes a generic contribution guidelines that it may be updated based on the Working Group needs.

- **CS_Template**

The [7._CS_Template.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/7._CS_Template.md) file is a Technical Specification template to build a technical document. In a repository it can be one or multiple of this template. Each technical document file should have an unique filename.

- **Release Planning.md**

The [9._Release_Planning.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/9._Release_Planning.md) file contains in its simple format a single table indicating what features will be released and by when.

> Note: 
>If it is expected that **`MYORG`** will have multiple repositories containing Technical Specifications, then we suggest that the document [`10._ORG_Process.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/10._ORG_Process.md) should be copied to a new repository, e.g., **`governance`**. This document contains processes that are generic across the Organization. If you need to create a new repository **`governance`**, please refer to the above intructions.

- **ORG_Process**

The [10._ORG_Process.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/V1.1/10._ORG_Process.md) file describes procedures and best practices on how to implement and run a Community Specification Project successfully. This document may change based on the needs of **`MYORG`**.
We recommend copying this file to a new repository, e.g., **`governance`**, especially if the Organization is planning to have more than one Working Group or repository.

After copying the above files to **`MYSPEC`** and **`governance`** repositories, you will need to update some template options and adjust some assumptions they contain.

### Step 2: Update the documents in **`MYSPEC`** repository

__To `edit` an existing file, takes these steps:__

> * Click on the filename in the **`MYSPEC`** or **`governance`** repository
> * On the file's page, click the `Edit button` (_looks like a pencil on the right side of the screen_)
> * Edit the file's text contents
> * After editing the text, in the `Commit changes` box at the bottom:
> * In the first text box, fill in a short description with a few words, e.g., `Edited Scope document`
> * In the second text box, where it says `Add an optional extended description...`, add a DCO sign-off line with the following, using your name and email address: `Signed-off-by: NAME <EMAIL ADDRESS>`
> * Make sure the `Commit directly to the correct branch` button is selected
> * Click the `Commit changes` button

__In **`MYSPEC`** repository fill in the required information for the following files:__

* `README.md`:
* Edit the `README.md` file to add a brief description of the specification.
  * You will want to include a reference back to the **`governance`** repo, such as the following (making appropriate substitutions):

```md
# MYSPEC Specification

This repo is used for collaboration and development of the MYSPEC specification.
The MYSPEC Specification is developed pursuant to the [MYORG Governance practices](https://github.com/MYORG/governance) and licensed pursuant to the [Community Specification License 1.1](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/1._Community_Specification_License.md).
Contributions to the MYSPEC Specification are required to be submitted pursuant to the [MYORG Contributor License Agreement 1.1](https://github.com/MYORG/MYSPEC/blob/main/.0_CS_Contributor_License_Agreement.md).
```

* `.0_CS_Contributor_License_Agreement.md`:
  * In the title of the document (in the first line), change __"Community Specification Contributor License Agreement 1.1"__ to __"MYORG Contributor License Agreement 1.1"__.

* `2._Scope.md`:
  * Complete the `Scope.md` file, which determines the scope of your Working Group and its patent coverage by:
  * Replace the first main sentence ("[Include a detailed description...") with a description of the substance of what the specification's scope will include.
  * The link to ISO's guidance (see page 5 of the linked PDF) may be useful in drafting the scope.

  > For an example, see [SPDX's Scope document](https://github.com/spdx/governance/blob/main/2._Scope.md).

* `3._Notices.md`:
  * Under `Code of Conduct` section, fill in the blank with names and email addresses for at least _two different individuals_ from the project who will be designated to receive Code of Conduct inquiries or issues.

> Note that these should be individual persons, and not general mailing list addresses. Ideally select two or more people from different employers / organizations.

   * After filling in the blank, delete the following sentence (*[Ideally list two different individuals...*)
   * Do not fill in the blanks for the remainder of the file, unless your organization is designating exclusions from the Community Specification License's patent license grant. If so, consult with your legal counsel about what should be filled in here.

* `4._License.md`:
  * If any source or sample code will be included in the specification, designate a source code license in the `4._License.md` file.
  * Under the __Specification License__ title, change "repository" to "**`MYORG`** GitHub organization".
  * Under __Source Code License__ title, the default license for software source code is **MIT**. If a license other than **MIT** will be used for software source code, then change each instance of **MIT** to the [SPDX License Identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses) for the chosen software license.

* `6._Contributing.md`:
  * Review this policy for the actual process of specification development and contributions, and make any appropriate changes for the way your project community will work.
  * If you revise the contents of the policy, also replace __Community Specification__ with **`MYORG`** in the name of the policy.

### Step 3: Changes to the **`governance`** repository

Assuming that a new repository **`governance`** was created, then update the `README.md`.

* `README.md`
  * Replace the generic **`governance`** README file with a brief description of the project's governance repo, such as the following:

```md
# MYORG Governance

This repo contains documents that describe the governance practices for the **`MYORG`** Working Group.
The **`MYORG`** Working Group oversees development of the **`MYORG`**  materials in the [MYORG GitHub org](https://github.com/MYORG). Specifications developed by the **`MYORG`**  Working Group are developed in their own repositories, and are subject to the licensing and governance policies described in this repo.
The **`MYORG`**  Governance process is based on the [Community Specification model and license](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/tree/V1.1) from the [Joint Development Foundation](https://www.jointdevelopment.org).
```  

# Best Practices.

1. **CLA bot.** 
Enable a CLA bot, such as EasyCLA or cla-bot, to require a **Community Specification Contributor License Agreement** be signed (either by an individual contributor or by a contributor's employer, which CLA covers the employed contributor) and in place prior to making any contribution.

1. **Use for specifications, not code.**  Use the Community Specification License for specification development, not code.

1. **Scope.** 
Draft the scope with care since it sets the outer bounds of the patent commitments participants make to the specification.  If you draft it too narrowly, you may limit the functionality of the specification, especially as the project progresses.  Draft it too broadly and it may provide a barrier to participation since participants may be unwilling to agree to potentially broad patent commitments.  For guidance on drafting an appropriate Scope, you may find [ISO How To Write Standards Guide](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/how-to-write-standards.pdf) helpful, (see page 5).

1. **Specification format.**  
Use the [Community Specification Template](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/7._CS_Template.md) to draft your specification.

1. **Develop specifications and code in separate repositories.**  
Where possible, separate specifications and source code into different repositories, with the specifications under the Community Specification License and the source code under an OSI-approved open source license.  

1. **Develop multiple specifications in separate repositories.** 
When developing multiple specifications, each individual specification should be in its own repository.
