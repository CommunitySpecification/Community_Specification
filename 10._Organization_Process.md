# `MYORG` Organization Process

## Scope

The Organization Process document provides practical guides on implementing a process aligned with the [5._Governance.md](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/5._Governance.md) document. The [5._Governance.md](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/5._Governance.md) is a high-level policy document supplied and controlled by the Joint Development Foundatio (JDF). 

In contrast, the **Organization_Process** is a low-level process template document provided by the JDF but under the control of each Organization. The Organization is encouraged to enhance this document as it sees fit.

## Overview


## Meetings
A group **meeting** needs a clear purpose agenda. 

* **Before the meeting, the Maintainer should:**
  * Announce the day and time for the meeting well in advance in advance before the meeting
  * Create a meeting agenda using a template, e.g., `agenda-template.`
  * Ask the Group for discussion topics to be added to the agenda.

* **At the beginning of the meeting:**
  * Record in the meeting notes the name, affiliation, or email address of all the meeting attendees.
  * Before starting the meeting, draw the attendee's attention to the anti-trust and IPR statements on the agenda. 
  * Review with the Group the meeting topics prior start the discussion and asking for additions or updates. Amend the agenda accordingly.
  * Ask for the agenda to be approved before beginning the formal debate.

* **During the meeting:**
  * Give each topic enough discussion time, or postpone the topic for the following meeting
  * Assign clear action items and takeaways

* **After the meeting:**
  * Share the Meeting notes with all the attendees and ask for comments or amendments. 


## Technical Decision Making
### Decision Making
As part of their responsibilities the Maintainers need to ensure efficient and effective decision-making:
* The decision-making process in Working Groups (WGs) is intended to be as inclusive as possible. 
* WGs SHALL attempt to use consensus to make decisions. 
* If consensus cannot be reached, voting mechanisms MAY be used. 


### Seeking Consensus

* In non-real-time meetings, consensus SHOULD be developed by using [Review and Approval](#review-approval) process.
  * Using the group mailing list
  * Using GitHub "Review and Approval" label
* Proposals SHALL be available for a [given period]().

#### Approval Process

In Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), the approval or rejection of a contribution follows a democratic process; **the majority**. This process differs from an Open Source organization, which usually follows a meritocratic process where the Maintainer decides what to accept or reject. If a person doesnâ€™t like the decision that her contribution is rejected, she can `fork` the project.

The goal for an SDO is to reach interoperability. Therefore `forking` is not the solution to a technical dispute. Suppose a contribution receives an  objection, which is not withdrawn (sustained objection). In this case, the objection SHOULD be resolved via a Working Group vote.

Voting in a Standards Organization to resolve technical issues is highly discouraged. It should be a rare event as voting on technical matters produces tension in the Working Groups.
