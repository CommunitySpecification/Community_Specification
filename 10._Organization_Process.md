# `MYORG` Organization Process

## Scope

This document provides practical steps to implement the **`MYORG`** process described in the document, [5._Governance.md](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/5._Governance.md).

## Overview


## Meetings
A meeting agenda helps you and your colleagues prepare for a meeting and guide yourselves through the items you need to discuss.

> Please refer to the support section [Meetings]() in the [Guidelines]() document or further information.


## Technical Decision-Making
The technical decision making process is a sequence of steps to help Working Groups define a problem, collect feedback, research solutions, and document the decision.

### Decision-Making
As part of their responsibilities, the Maintainers need to ensure efficient and effective collaboration:
* The decision-making process in Working Groups (WGs) is intended to be as inclusive as possible. 
* WGs SHALL attempt to use consensus to make decisions. 
* Voting should be used as the last resource to resolve a technical dispute.


### Seeking Consensus

* In non-real-time meetings, the Working Group should use [Review and Approval](#review-and-approval) process to reach consensus.

> Note: Review & Approval should be in conjunction with:
> * the group mailing list, and
> * the GitHub "Review and Approval" `R&A` label

### Review and Approval Process

In Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), the approval or rejection of a contribution follows a democratic process; the **Unanimous Agreement**. 

The SDOs use the Review & Approval process to reach a consensus inside a  Working Group. During this process, the Working Group reviews a particular Contribution for a pre-designated period, e.g., *day(s)*. At the end of that period, the Maintainer can merge the Contribution if, e.g.:
* The Contribution has received three *OK's*, and 
* no Objections. 

If the Contribution receives a *Comment*, it is up to the Maintainer to decide how to incorporate it into the Technical Specifications. However, if the Contribution receives an *Objection*, the Maintainer cannot merge the Contribution, and the Working Group must review it before deciding its final disposition (accepted or rejected).

### Specifications Development Stages

This section expands the previous Development phase by breaking it down into development steps.

The diagram depicts a timeline suggesting the amount of effort for each development step, the main milestones, and the output from each phase.

## Using GitHub
### Community Specification Git Flow Implementation

      <img src="images/jdf-flow-2.drawio.svg" alt="Community Specification Git Flow">
      <figcaption>Community Specification Git Flow</figcaption>
</figure>

The diagram in this section suggests how to implement a Git Flow that uses three branches:
* `draft`
  * This is the branch where the Working Group is developing the Specifications.
Submitters have 45 days from submission day to exclude any [Necessary Claims]()
* `pending-approval` (by the Working Group), and 
  * The content on this branch cannot be modified for at least 45 days before merging its content into the "approved" branch
`approved`

Content in this branch IS NOT subject to any [Patent Exclusion]()
The actions are color-coded by roles:
* Members or Participants
* Editors, and 
* Maintainers

This diagram suggests a Git Flow that meets the legal requirements described in Section `3. Patent Exclusion` of the [1._Community Specification License 1.1](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/1._Community_Specification_License-v1.md) document.


## Documentation
### Semantic Versioning
Version Control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to documents or software code.

      <figcaption>Semantic Versioning</figcaption>
</figure>

The criteria for updating the version of an APPROVED document follows the principles of Semantic Versioning described table.

table>
  <caption>Document Version</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Use</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>X</td>
    <td><i>Major Version Indicator</i></td>
    <td>This field is mandatory and identifies the MAJOR version of the document as determined by the Working Group.

 MAJOR versions contain major feature additions; MAY contain incompatibilities with previous document or specification revisions; and MAY change, drop, or replace existing interfaces. 
 
 Initial releases are version "V1.0".
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Y</td>
    <td><i>Minor Version Indicator</i></td>
    <td>This field is mandatory and identifies the MINOR version of the documentâ€”this digit version increments in one when the approved document is modified.

MINOR versions MAY contain minor feature additions, are compatible with the preceding MAJOR_MINOR specification revision, and provide evolving interfaces. The initial MINOR release for any MAJOR release is "0", i.e., 1.0</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Z</td>
    <td><i>Service Indicator</i></td>
    <td>This third digit is optional but recommended to identify bug fixes or editorial changes. It is called <i>Service Indicator</i> (SI). 

The digit increments every time a corrective update - <strong>Approved</strong> by the Working Group and <strong>Ratified</strong> by the parent group - is applied to the document already under version control.
 The first <i>Service Indicator</i> release SHALL be "_1" for any MAJOR_MINOR release, e.g., V1.0.1.

<i>Service Indicators</i> are compatible with the MAJOR_MINOR release they relate to but add bug fixes. 

MAJOR or MINOR changes to the documents under Version Control cannot be classified with a change on the <i>Service Indicator</i>
