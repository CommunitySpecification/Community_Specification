# `MYORG` Organization Process

## Scope

The Organization Process document provides practical guides on implementing a process aligned with the [5._Governance.md](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/5._Governance.md) document. The [5._Governance.md](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/5._Governance.md) is a high-level policy document supplied and controlled by the Joint Development Foundatio (JDF). 

In contrast, the [10._Organization_Process.md]() is a low-level process template document provided by the JDF but under the control of each Organization. The Organization is encouraged to enhance this document as it sees fit.

## Overview


## Meetings
A group **meeting** needs a clear purpose agenda. 

* **Before the meeting, the Maintainer should:**
  * Announce the day and time for the meeting well in advance in advance before the meeting
  * Create a meeting agenda using a template, e.g., [agenda-template]().
  * Ask the Group for discussion topics to be added to the agenda.

* **At the beginning of the meeting:**
  * Record in the meeting notes the name, affiliation, or email address of all the meeting attendees.
  * Before starting the meeting, draw the attendee's attention to the anti-trust and IPR statements on the agenda. 
  * Review with the Group the meeting topics prior start the discussion and asking for additions or updates. Amend the agenda accordingly.
  * Ask for the agenda to be approved before beginning the formal debate.

* **During the meeting:**
  * Give each topic enough discussion time, or postpone the topic for the following meeting
  * Assign clear action items and takeaways

* **After the meeting:**
  * Share the Meeting notes with all the attendees and ask for comments or amendments. 


## Technical Decision-Making
The technical decision making process is a sequence of steps to help Working Groups define a problem, collect feedback, research solutions, and document the decision.

### Decision-Making
As part of their responsibilities the Maintainers need to ensure efficient and effective collaboration:
* The decision-making process in Working Groups (WGs) is intended to be as inclusive as possible. 
* WGs SHALL attempt to use consensus to make decisions. 
* If consensus cannot be reached, voting mechanisms MAY be used. 


### Seeking Consensus

* In non-real-time meetings, consensus SHOULD be developed by using [Review and Approval](#review-approval) process.
  * Using the group mailing list
  * Using GitHub "Review and Approval" `R&A` label
  * Proposals SHALL be available for a [given period]().

### Approval Process

In Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), the approval or rejection of a contribution follows a democratic process; **the majority**. This process differs from an Open Source organization, which usually follows a meritocratic process where the Maintainer decides what to accept or reject. If a person doesn’t like the decision that her contribution is rejected, she can `fork` the project.

The goal for an SDO is to reach interoperability. Therefore `forking` is not the solution to a technical dispute. Suppose a contribution receives an  objection, which is not withdrawn (sustained objection). In this case, the objection SHOULD be resolved via a Working Group vote.

Voting in a Standards Organization to resolve technical issues is highly discouraged. It should be a rare event as voting on technical matters produces tension in the Working Groups.

## Standards Lifecycle
### Specifications Lifecycle

<figure class="text-center">
      <img src="images/StandardsPhases.drawio.svg" alt="Standards Life Cycle">
      <figcaption>Standards Life Cycle</figcaption>
</figure>

Usually, the development of Technical Specifications has six stages:

1.- The first stage defines the [Work Package]() document, which contains the scope and expected deliverables of the Technical Specifications. 

2.- The next stage is the development of Technical documents; see [Specifications Development Stages]() for further information. This development may follow a _water-fall_ or an _agile_  process. In any case, the documents to develop, e.g., [Use Cases](), [Requirements](), [Architecture]() vary according to the needs of the Project.

3.- After completing the Development of Technical Documents, the next stage is the [Consistency Reivew](). In this review, it is essential to incorporate people that didn't participate in the Development of the Technical Documents created by the Working Group. The stage's main objective is to validate the content and clarity of the Technical Documents; e.g., the content doesn't contain mistakes or is open for interpretation. During the review period set by the Working Group, participants will provide comments that the Working Group will review before closing the Consistency Review.

4.- After closing all the comments received during the [Consistency Review](), the next stage is the [Approval]() of the Technical Documents produced and reviewed by the Working Group. 

5.- The next stage after the Working Group has formally Approved the Technical Documents is the [Ratification]() of the Technical Documents. The [Ratification]() is performed by the parent group, in most cases, the Technical Steering Committee. This stage aims to officially bind the Specifications approved by the Working Group to the project's legal terms.

6.- The final stage is the [Publication]() where the new Technical Specifications are widely available to the Community.

> Note: 
> The Group is encouraged to cover the checklists for each stage.



### Specifications Development Stages

</figure>

The above diagram expands the Development stage represented in the [Specifications Lifecy]() section by breaking it down into development phases.  
It is up to the Working Group to decide if the development of the Technical documents will follow a _water-fall_ or an _agile_  approach. In any case, the documents to be developed, e.g., [Use Cases](), [Requirements](), [Architecture](), vary according to the needs of the Project.

The diagram also depicts a timeline suggesting the amount of effort for each development stage and the main milestones and output from each phase.

## Using GitHub
### Community Specification Git Flow Implementation


<figure class="text-center">
      <img src="images/jdf-flow-2.drawio.svg" alt="Community Specification Git Flow">
      <figcaption>Community Specification Git Flow</figcaption>
</figure>

The diagram in this section suggests how to implement a Git Flow that uses three branches:
* `draft`
  * This is the branch where the Working Group is developing the Specifications.
Submitters have 45 days from submission day to exclude any [Necessary Claims]()
* `pending-approval` (by the Working Group), and 
  * The content on this branch cannot be modified for at least 45 days before merging its content into the "approved" branch
`approved`

Content in this branch IS NOT subject to any [Patent Exclusion]()
The actions are color-coded by roles:
* Members or Participants
* Editors, and 
* Maintainers

Using these branches and in the sequence provided, the group will meet the legal requirements described in Section `3. Patent Exclusion` of the [1._Community Specification License 1.1](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/1._Community_Specification_License-v1.md) document.

### Semantic Versioning


<figure class="text-center">
      <img src="images/SemanticVersioning.drawio.svg" alt="Semantic Versioning">
      <figcaption>Semantic Versioning</figcaption>
</figure>

Technical Specifications are placed under Version Control (Vx.y.z) as soon as they have been [Ratified]() by the parent of the Working Group. 
When Technical Documents are under Version Control, any further changes to the documents will require creating a new set of the document(s) under different versions, e.g., from V1.0 to V1.0.1.

The criteria for choosing the new version of an APPROVED follows the principles of Semantic Versioning and are as follows:

<table>
  <caption>Document Version</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
	    <th>Field</th>
	    <th>Use</th>
	    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>X</td>
    <td><i>Major Version Indicator</i></td>
    <td>This mandatory field SHALL identify the major version of the document as determined by the WG.
      Major versions contain major feature additions; MAYcontain incompatibilities with previous document or specification revisions; and MAY change, drop, or replace existing interfaces. Initial releases are “1_0”.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Y</td>
    <td><i>Minor Version Indicator</i></td>
    <td>Minor version of the document. This mandatory field SHALL identify the minor version of the document. It is incremented every time a minor change is made to the approved document version. Minor versions MAY contain minor feature additions, are compatible with the preceding Major_Minor specification revision, and MAY provide evolving interfaces. The initial minor release for any major release is “0”, i.e., 1_0</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Z</td>
    <td><i>Service Indicator</i></td>
    <td>Service indicator for the document. Incremented every time a corrective update is made to the <strong>Approved</strong> (not draft) document version by the WG.
    This field is OPTIONAL, and SHALL be provided whenever a service release of the document is made. The first service indicator release SHALL be “_1” for any Major_Minor release.
    Service indicators are intended to be compatible with the Major_Minor release they relate to but add bug fixes. Major or Minor changes to the documents under Version Control cannot be classified with a change on the <i>Service Indicator</i>
    </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
