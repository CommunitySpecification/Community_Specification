# `MYORG` Organization Process

## Scope

The Organization Process document provides practical guides on implementing a process aligned with the [5._Governance.md](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/5._Governance.md) document. The `5._Governance.md` is a high-level policy document supplied and controlled by the Joint Development Foundatio (JDF). 
In contrast, the **Organization_Process** is a low-level process template document provided by the JDF but under the control of each Organization. The Organization is encouraged to enhance this document as it sees fit.
