# `MYORG` Organization Process

## Scope

The Organization Process document provides practical guides on implementing a process aligned with the [5._Governance.md](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/5._Governance.md) document. The `5._Governance.md` is a high-level policy document supplied and controlled by the Joint Development Foundatio (JDF). 
In contrast, the **Organization_Process** is a low-level process template document provided by the JDF but under the control of each Organization. The Organization is encouraged to enhance this document as it sees fit.

## Overview


## Meetings
* WGs are encouraged to schedule regular conference calls.
* The Meetings MUST be announced at least sevent, (7) days in advance for conference calls, and one (1) month for face-to-face meetings.
* All the Organization members are contractually bound to the IPR policy under terms of the Membership Application.
* Meetings SHALL have an antitrust statement and an IPR call where a reminder of the IPR policy and the duties and obligations of members is provided.
* A meeting attendee list MUST be produced for each meeting. This list is necessary to determine which members can vote in a Supermajority vote if one is needed.

## Technical Decision Making
### Decision Making
As part of their responsibilities the Maintainers need to ensure efficient and effective decision-making:
* The decision-making process in Working Groups (WGs) is intended to be as inclusive as possible. 
* WGs SHALL attempt to use consensus to make decisions. 
* If consensus cannot be reached, voting mechanisms MAY be used. 
* Formal notice SHALL be given for decision making, e.g.:
  * Inclusion of a document on the agenda, proposing a specific decision to be taken (e.g., Pull Request).
  * Inclusion of an item directly in the agenda (e.g., proposed next meeting date).
  * Items proposed for approval via the group mailing list (e.g., agreement a document revision).
  * Inclusion of a document for decision in an electronic Review and Approval event
  * Inclusion of a document for decision in an e-vote (Supermajority) vote.
 
 > The above list is not exhaustive.

* There SHALL be no distinction in the decision-making merit of real-time or non-real-time meetings.
  * In real-time meetings, consensus can be determined by receiving no sustained objections to a proposal. 
  * In non-real-time meetings, consensus SHOULD be developed using Review and Agreement periods, e.g., using [Review and Approval](#approval-process)
* Proposals SHALL be available for review for a given period, agreed by the Working Group

### Seeking Consensus
* Groups SHALL endeavour to reach a consensus on all decisions. 
* Informal methods of reaching consensus are encouraged (e.g., a show of hands).
* Groups SHOULD attempt to ensure contributions relating to the same subject matter are considered together before being reviewed. 
* However the Maintainer SHALL ensure that progress is not delayed by unavailable contributions or participants.
* Agreement SHALL be sought in all forms of meeting.
* Objections from a small minority SHOULD be minuted, and the objecting delegates SHOULD be questioned if having their objections minuted is sufficient, and they agree not to sustain their objections. 
  * If such agreements are secured, there is a consensus for approving the proposal. 
  * If such agreements are not secured, then the proposal is not agreed upon, and further action SHALL be taken (e.g., the proposal is withdrawn, updated, or voted on). 
  * Members are discouraged from sustaining their objections when it is clear that a vote will override them.
* In real-time meetings, consensus can be determined by receiving no sustained objections to a proposal.
  * Efforts to immediately resolve or record objections can be taken to attempt to achieve consensus.
* Where attendance is sparse when viewed from normal participation levels, potentially controversial proposals SHOULD be made available to the broader membership. 
* The Maintainer is responsible for ensuring such opportunity for participation in the decision-making process. 
* Sparsely attended meetings SHOULD NOT be used to drive through proposals that would not have broad support.
* Following a decision-making meeting, a summary of decisions and document dispositions SHALL be published as soon as is practical. 
  * This will be addressed if the meeting minutes are available in a timely fashion.
* When there is insufficient time for review in a real-time meeting, non-real-time consensus approaches SHOULD be considered.  
* In non-real-time meetings, consensus SHOULD be developed by using [Review and Approval](#review-approval) periods.
  * Using the group mailing list
  * Using GitHub "Review and Approval" label
* Proposals SHALL be available for a [given period]().

### Approval Process

In Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), the approval or rejection of a contribution follows a democratic process; **the majority**. This process differs from an Open Source organization, which usually follows a meritocratic process where the Maintainer decides what to accept or reject. If a person doesn’t like the decision that her contribution is rejected, she can `fork` the project.

The goal for an SDO is to reach interoperability. Therefore `forking` is not the solution to a technical dispute. Suppose a contribution receives an  objection, which is not withdrawn (sustained objection). In this case, the objection SHOULD be resolved via a Working Group vote.

Voting in a Standards Organization to resolve technical issues is highly discouraged. It should be a rare event as voting on technical matters produces tension in the Working Groups.

#### Review & Approval Process
The Review & Approval process implies that the Working Group SHOULD seek agreement on its technical-decision-making.

* **Review period**:
    * Period when the contribution is reviewed before being accepted.
      * The period can be: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14 days
      * 0 days imply that the contribution is merged without a Working Group review

* **Comments or Objections**:
    * During the Review & Approval process members MAY raise **comments** or **objections**.
      * **Comments** the Working Groups MUST consider the comments, but they MAY be dismissed if they group thinks that are irrelevant.

      * **Objections** MUST be taken into consideration, and the Working Group cannot dismiss them without being reviewed. 
      * If a contribution receives an **objection**, the Working Group MUST resolve the issue with the person who raises the objection before deciding the contribution status. 
      * If the **objection** is sustained, meaning the person doesn’t remove it, the group will have to recur to a vote to resolve it.

* **Approval Criteria**:
    * A contribution is considered **Approved** and therefore it can be merged if:
      * The contribution has not received any sustainable **objection** during the review period, AND at least three (3) reviewers have indicated that they agree with the contribution
    * If a sustained **objection** is received, the contribution cannot be merged, even if thee (3) or more contributors agreed with the contribution. 
    * If during the review period a contribution receives a **comment**, it is up to the group or maintainer to accept the comment or not. To merge the contribution, at least three (3) reviewers MUST indicate that they agree with the contribution.
