# `MYORG` Organization Process

## Scope

This document provides practical steps to implement the **`MYORG`** process described in the document, [5._Governance.md](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/5._Governance.md).

## Overview


## Meetings
A meeting agenda helps you and your colleagues prepare for a meeting and guide yourselves through the items you need to discuss.

> For further information, please refer to the [Meetings]() section of the [Guidelines]() wiki.


## Technical Decision-Making
The technical decision making process is a sequence of steps to help Working Groups define a problem, collect feedback, research solutions, and document the decision.

### Decision-Making
As part of their responsibilities, the Maintainers need to ensure efficient and effective collaboration:
* The decision-making process in Working Groups (WGs) is intended to be as inclusive as possible. 
* WGs SHALL attempt to use consensus to make decisions. 
* Voting should be used as the last resource to resolve a technical dispute.


### Seeking Consensus

* In non-real-time meetings, the Working Group should use [Review and Approval](#review-and-approval) process to reach consensus.

> Note: Review & Approval should be in conjunction with:
> * the group mailing list, and
> * the GitHub "Review and Approval" `R&A` label

### Review and Approval Process

In Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), the approval or rejection of a contribution follows a democratic process; the **Unanimous Agreement**. 

The SDOs use the [Review and Approval](#review-and-approval) process to reach a consensus inside a  Working Group. During this process, the Working Group reviews a particular Contribution for a pre-designated period, e.g., *day(s)*. At the end of that period, the Maintainer can merge the Contribution if, e.g.:
* The *Contribution* has received three *OK's*, and 
* no *Objections*. 

If the *Contribution* receives a *Comment*, it is up to the *Maintainer* to decide how to incorporate it into the *Technical Specifications*. However, if the *Contribution* receives an *Objection*, the *Maintainer* cannot merge the *Contribution*, and the *Working Group* must review it before deciding its final disposition (accepted or rejected).

### Specifications Development Stages

This section expands the previous Development phase by breaking it down into development steps.

The diagram depicts a timeline suggesting the amount of effort for each development step, the main milestones, and the output from each phase.

## Using GitHub
### Community Specification Git Flow Implementation
This diagram suggests a Git Flow that meets the legal requirements described in Section `3. Patent Exclusion` of the [1._Community Specification License 1.1](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/Community_Specification/blob/V1.1/1._Community_Specification_License-v1.md) document.

## Documentation
### Semantic Versioning
Version Control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to documents or software code.

The criteria for updating the version of an APPROVED document follows the principles of Semantic Versioning described table.

<table>
  <caption>Document Version</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Use</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>X</td>
    <td><i>Major Version Indicator</i></td>
    <td>This field is mandatory and identifies the MAJOR version of the document as determined by the Working Group.

 MAJOR versions contain major feature additions; MAY contain incompatibilities with previous document or specification revisions; and MAY change, drop, or replace existing interfaces. 
 
 Initial releases are version "V1.0".
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Y</td>
    <td><i>Minor Version Indicator</i></td>
    <td>This field is mandatory and identifies the MINOR version of the documentâ€”this digit version increments in one when the approved document is modified.

MINOR versions MAY contain minor feature additions, are compatible with the preceding MAJOR_MINOR specification revision, and provide evolving interfaces. The initial MINOR release for any MAJOR release is "0", i.e., 1.0</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Z</td>
    <td><i>Service Indicator</i></td>
    <td>This third digit is optional but recommended to identify bug fixes or editorial changes. It is called <i>Service Indicator</i> (SI). 

The digit increments every time a corrective update - <strong>Approved</strong> by the Working Group and <strong>Ratified</strong> by the parent group - is applied to the document already under version control.
 The first <i>Service Indicator</i> release SHALL be "_1" for any MAJOR_MINOR release, e.g., V1.0.1.

<i>Service Indicators</i> are compatible with the MAJOR_MINOR release they relate to but add bug fixes. 

MAJOR or MINOR changes to the documents under Version Control cannot be classified with a change on the <i>Service Indicator</i>
